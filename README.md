# Reinforcement-Learning  
🛰️ Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) for Lunar Lander 🛰️
Welcome to the DDPG Lunar Lander project! This repository implements the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm using PyTorch to solve the LunarLanderContinuous-v2 environment from OpenAI's Gym.
